Image caption generation represents a fascinating realm within the domain of Artificial Intelligence, captivating the attention of researchers and developers alike. The primary goal is to develop an advanced image caption generator that can autonomously produce coherent English captions for input images.  This process involves leveraging deep learning to comprehend the context of an image and furnish it with pertinent captions. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision, this technology aims to understand and describe the content of images in a way that aligns with human interpretation.It employs a combination of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, specifically VGG16, along with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
